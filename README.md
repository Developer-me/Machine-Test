# Machine-Test

I have given an assignment to create three screens Sign-In,Sign-Up and Homepage respectively. The Sign In screen contains two text-fields, two labels and one button. The Sign Up screen almost following the same pattern with an addition of one extra button. The final screen have a table view and a logout button. And the table view contains one image view and two labels to display the response that I got from API call. I have done the API with the help of some third party libraries such as Alamofire,Kingfisher. I have also given a second task which is a logical type question to solve with my own code. I have put all my effort to complete the task, but unfortunately I canâ€™t complete it.


Thanks to Aeth Analytica for considering and giving me an opportunity like this.
